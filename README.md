# 🔐 Cybersecurity Study Archive

This repository is a collection of my personal notes and study materials on cybersecurity.  
Originally maintained in Notion, I’ve migrated the content to GitHub Pages to organize it more systematically and make it publicly accessible.

📌 Topics Covered:
- Cryptography
- Vulnerability Research
- Penetration Testing
- Reverse Engineering
- CTF Writeups

The content ranges from quick notes to hands-on analysis and practical summaries.  
If you find any inaccuracies, feel free to submit feedback or open an issue.

> 💡 Goal: To structure scattered knowledge into an organized archive for both personal growth and open sharing with fellow learners.
